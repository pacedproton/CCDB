       [1mINTRODUCTION[0m


            Almost  every program development environment worthy of
       the name provides some sort of debugging facility.   Usually
       this  takes  the  form  of  a  program  which  is capable of
       controlling execution of other programs  and  examining  the
       internal  state of other executing programs.  These types of
       programs will be referred to as external debuggers since the
       debugger  is not part of the executing program.  Examples of
       this type of debugger include  the  [1madb  [22mand  [1msdb  [22mdebuggers
       provided with the [1mUNIX1 [22moperating system.


            One of the problems associated with developing programs
       in an environment  with  good  external  debuggers  is  that
       developed  programs  tend  to  have  little  or  no internal
       instrumentation.  This is usually  not  a  problem  for  the
       developer  since  he  is,  or at least should be, intimately
       familiar with the internal  organization,  data  structures,
       and  control  flow  of  the program being debugged.  It is a
       serious  problem  for  maintenance  programmers,   who   are
       unlikely  to  have  such  familiarity with the program being
       maintained, modified, or ported to another environment.   It
       is  also a problem, even for the developer, when the program
       is moved to an environment with a  primitive  or  unfamiliar
       debugger, or even no debugger.


            On  the  other  hand, [4mdbug[24m is an example of an internal
       debugger.  Because it requires internal instrumentation of a
       program,  and  its  usage  does  not  depend  on any special
       capabilities of the  execution  environment,  it  is  always
       available  and  will  execute  in  any  environment that the
       program itself will execute in.  In addition, since it is  a
       complete   package  with  a  specific  user  interface,  all
       programs  which  use  it  will  be  provided  with   similar
       debugging  capabilities.  This is in sharp contrast to other
       forms of internal instrumentation where each  developer  has
       their  own, usually less capable, form of internal debugger.
       In summary, because [4mdbug[24m is an internal debugger it provides
       consistency across operating environments, and because it is
       available to all developers it provides  consistency  across
       all programs in the same environment.


            The [4mdbug[24m package imposes only a slight speed penalty on
       executing programs, typically much less than 10 percent, and
       a  modest  size  penalty,  typically  10  to 20 percent.  By
       defining a specific C preprocessor symbol both of these  can
       be  reduced  to  zero with no changes required to the source

            The  following  list  is  a  quick   summary   of   the
       capabilities  of  the  [4mdbug[24m package.  Each capability can be
       individually enabled or disabled at the time  a  program  is
       invoked   by   specifying   the   appropriate  command  line
       arguments.

               o Execution trace  showing  function  level  control
                 flow    in   a   semi‚Äêgraphically   manner   using
                 indentation to indicate nesting depth.

               o Output the values of all, or any  subset  of,  key
                 internal variables.

               o Limit   actions   to   a  specific  set  of  named
                 functions.

               o Limit function trace to a specified nesting depth.

               o Label each output line with source file  name  and
                 line number.

               o Label  each  output  line  with  name  of  current
                 process.

               o Push or pop  internal  debugging  state  to  allow
                 execution with built in debugging defaults.

               o Redirect  the  debug  output  stream  to  standard
                 output (stdout) or  a  named  file.   The  default
                 output  stream  is  standard  error (stderr).  The
                 redirection mechanism is completely independent of
                 normal  command  line  redirection to avoid output
                 conflicts.

       [1mPRIMITIVE DEBUGGING TECHNIQUES[0m


            Internal instrumentation is already a familiar  concept
       to most programmers, since it is usually the first debugging
       technique  learned.    Typically,   "print statements"   are
       inserted  in the source code at interesting points, the code
       is recompiled and executed,  and  the  resulting  output  is
       examined in an attempt to determine where the problem is.

       The  procedure  is  iterative,  with each iteration yielding
       more and more  output,  and  hopefully  the  source  of  the
       problem is discovered before the output becomes too large to
       deal with or  previously  inserted  statements  need  to  be
       removed.   Figure  1 is an example of this type of primitive
       debugging technique.



                 main (argc, argv)
                 int argc;
                 char *argv[];
                 {
                     printf ("argv[0] = %d\n", argv[0]);
                     /*
                      *    Rest of program
                      */
                     printf ("== done ==\n");
                 }


                                        Figure 1
                              Primitive Debugging Technique





            Eventually,  and  usually  after   at   least   several
       iterations,  the  problem  will  be found and corrected.  At
       this point, the newly  inserted  print  statements  must  be
       dealt  with.   One obvious solution is to simply delete them
       all.  Beginners usually do this a few times until they  have
       to  repeat  the entire process every time a new bug pops up.
       The second most obvious solution is to somehow  disable  the
       output,  either  through  the  source code comment facility,
       creation of a debug variable to be switched on or off, or by
       using  the  C  preprocessor.   Figure 2 is an example of all
       three techniques.

                 int debug = 0;

                 main (argc, argv)
                 int argc;
                 char *argv[];
                 {
                     /* printf ("argv = %x\n", argv) */
                     if (debug) printf ("argv[0] = %d\n", argv[0]);
                     /*
                      *    Rest of program
                      */
                 #ifdef DEBUG
                     printf ("== done ==\n");
                 #endif
                 }

                                Debug Disable Techniques





            Each technique has  its  advantages  and  disadvantages
       with  respect  to  dynamic vs static activation, source code
       overhead, recompilation requirements, ease of  use,  program
       readability,  etc.   Overuse  of  the  preprocessor solution
       quickly leads to problems with source code  readability  and
       maintainability  when  multiple  [1m#ifdef  [22msymbols  are  to be
       defined or  undefined  based  on  specific  types  of  debug
       desired.  The source code can be made slightly more readable
       by suitable indentation of the [1m#ifdef [22marguments to match the
       indentation  of  the code, but not all C preprocessors allow
       this.   The  only  requirement  for  the  standard  [1mUNIX   [22mC
       preprocessor is for the ‚Äô#‚Äô character to appear in the first
       column,  but  even  this  seems  like   an   arbitrary   and
       unreasonable  restriction.   Figure  3 is an example of this
       usage.

       [1mFUNCTION TRACE EXAMPLE[0m


            We will start off learning about  the  capabilities  of
       the  [4mdbug[24m  package  by  using  a simple minded program which
       computes the factorial of a  number.   In  order  to  better
       demonstrate  the  function  trace mechanism, this program is
       implemented recursively.  Figure 4 is the main function  for
       this factorial program.



                 #include <dbug.h>

                 int main (argc, argv)
                 int argc;
                 char *argv[];
                 {
                   int result, ix;
                   extern int factorial(int);
                   DBUG_ENTER ("main");
                   DBUG_PROCESS (argv[0]);
                   for (ix = 1; ix < argc && argv[ix][0] == ‚Äô‚Äê‚Äô; ix++) {
                     switch (argv[ix][1]) {
                     case ‚Äô#‚Äô:
                       DBUG_PUSH (&(argv[ix][2]));
                       break;
                     }
                   }
                   for (; ix < argc; ix++) {
                     DBUG_PRINT ("args", ("argv[%d] = %s", ix, argv[ix]));
                     result = factorial (atoi(argv[ix]));
                     printf ("%d\n", result);
                   }
                   DBUG_RETURN (0);
                 }

            The  [1mmain  [22mfunction  is  responsible for processing any
       command  line  option  arguments  and  then  computing   and
       printing the factorial of each non‚Äêoption argument.

            First of all, notice that all of the debugger functions
       are implemented via  preprocessor  macros.   This  does  not
       detract from the readability of the code and makes disabling
       all debug compilation trivial (a single preprocessor symbol,
       [1mDBUG_OFF[22m, forces the macro expansions to be null).


                                   ‚Äê 7 ‚Äê





       DBUG User Manual                           September 3, 2013



            Also  notice  the  inclusion  of the header file [1mdbug.h[0m
       from the local header file directory.  (The version included
       here  is  the  test  version in the dbug source distribution
       directory).  This file contains all the definitions for  the
       debugger macros, which all have the form [1mDBUG_XX...XX[22m.


            The [1mDBUG_ENTER [22mmacro informs that debugger that we have
       entered the function named [1mmain[22m.  It must be the very  first
       "executable"  line in a function, after all declarations and
       before any other executable line.  The [1mDBUG_PROCESS [22mmacro is
       generally  used only once per program to inform the debugger
       what name the program was invoked with.  The [1mDBUG_PUSH [22mmacro
       modifies  the  current debugger state by saving the previous
       state and setting a new state based on  the  control  string
       passed  as  its  argument.   The [1mDBUG_PRINT [22mmacro is used to
       print the values of each argument for which a  factorial  is
       to  be  computed.   The [1mDBUG_RETURN [22mmacro tells the debugger
       that the end of the current function has  been  reached  and
       returns  a  value  to  the  calling  function.  All of these
       macros will be fully explained in subsequent sections.

            To use the debugger, the factorial program  is  invoked
       with a command line of the form:

                          factorial ‚Äê#d:t 1 2 3

       The  [1mmain  [22mfunction  recognizes  the  "‚Äê#d:t"  string  as  a
       debugger control string, and passes the  debugger  arguments
       ("d:t")  to  the  [4mdbug[24m  runtime  support  routines  via  the
       [1mDBUG_PUSH [22mmacro.  This particular string enables output from
       the  [1mDBUG_PRINT [22mmacro with the ‚Äôd‚Äô flag and enables function
       tracing with the ‚Äôt‚Äô flag.  The factorial function  is  then
       called  three  times,  with the arguments "1", "2", and "3".
       Note that the DBUG_PRINT takes exactly [1mtwo  [22marguments,  with
       the  second  argument (a format string and list of printable
       values) enclosed in parentheses.

            Debug control strings consist of a  header,  the  "‚Äê#",
       followed  by  a  colon separated list of debugger arguments.
       Each debugger argument is a single character  flag  followed
       by an optional comma separated list of arguments specific to
       the given flag.  Some examples are:

                          ‚Äê#d:t:o
                          ‚Äê#d,in,out:f,main:F:L

       Note  that  previously  enabled  debugger  actions  can   be
       disabled by the control string "‚Äê#".


            The definition of the factorial function, symbolized as
       "N!", is given by:

       Figure 5 is the factorial  function  which  implements  this
       algorithm  recursively.   Note  that this is not necessarily
       the best way to  do  factorials  and  error  conditions  are
       ignored completely.

                     DBUG_PRINT ("find", ("find %d factorial", value));
                     if (value > 1) {
                      value *= factorial (value ‚Äê 1);
                     }
                     DBUG_PRINT ("result", ("result is %d", value));
                     DBUG_RETURN (value);
                 }

            One  advantage  (some  may not consider it so) to using
       the [4mdbug[24m  package  is  that  it  strongly  encourages  fully
       structured  coding with only one entry and one exit point in
       each function.  Multiple exit points, such as early  returns
       to  escape a loop, may be used, but each such point requires
       the use of an appropriate  [1mDBUG_RETURN  [22mor  [1mDBUG_VOID_RETURN[0m
       macro.


            To  build  the  factorial  program  on  a  [1mUNIX [22msystem,
       compile and link with the command:

                cc ‚Äêo factorial main.c factorial.c ‚Äêldbug

       The "‚Äêldbug" argument  tells  the  loader  to  link  in  the
       runtime support modules for the [4mdbug[24m package.  Executing the
       factorial program with a command of the form:

                           factorial 1 2 3 4 5

       generates the output shown in figure 6.

            This trace output indicates that there was  an  initial
       call  to  factorial from main (to compute 2!), followed by a
       single recursive call to factorial to compute 1!.  The  main
       program  then  output  the  result  for  2!  and  called the
       factorial  function  again  with  the  second  argument,  3.
       Factorial  called  itself  recursively to compute 2! and 1!,
       then returned control to main, which output the value for 3!
       and exited.


            Note  that there is no matching entry point "main>" for
       the return point "<main" because at the time the  [1mDBUG_ENTER[0m
       macro  was reached in main, tracing was not enabled yet.  It
       was only  after  the  macro  [1mDBUG_PUSH  [22mwas  executing  that
       tracing became enabled.  This implies that the argument list
       should be processed as early  as  possible  since  all  code
       preceding   the  first  call  to  [1mDBUG_PUSH  [22mis  essentially
       invisible to [4mdbug[24m (this can be worked around by inserting  a
       temporary    [1mDBUG_PUSH(argv[1])    [22mimmediately   after   the
       [1mDBUG_ENTER("main") [22mmacro.


            One last note, the trace output normally comes  out  on
       the  standard error.  Since the factorial program prints its
       result on the standard output, there is the  possibility  of
       the  output  on  the  terminal  being  scrambled  if the two
       streams are not synchronized.  Thus the debugger is told  to
       write its output on the standard output instead, via the ‚Äôo‚Äô
       flag character.   Note  that  no  ‚Äôo‚Äô  implies  the  default
       (standard  error),  a  ‚Äôo‚Äô  with no arguments means standard
       output, and a ‚Äôo‚Äô with an  argument  means  used  the  named
       file.   i.e,  "factorial ‚Äê#t:o,logfile 3 2"  would write the
       trace output in "logfile".  Because of  [1mUNIX  [22mimplementation
       details,  programs usually run faster when writing to stdout
       rather than stderr, though this is not a prime consideration
       in this example.

       [1mUSE OF DBUG_PRINT MACRO[0m


            The  mechanism used to produce "printf" style output is
       the [1mDBUG_PRINT [22mmacro.


            To allow selection of output from specific macros,  the
       first  argument to every [1mDBUG_PRINT [22mmacro is a [4mdbug[24m keyword.
       When this keyword appears in the argument list  of  the  ‚Äôd‚Äô
       flag     in     a    debug    control    string,    as    in
       "‚Äê#d,keyword1,keyword2,...:t", output from the corresponding
       macro  is enabled.  The default when there is no ‚Äôd‚Äô flag in
       the control string is to enable output from  all  [1mDBUG_PRINT[0m
       macros.


            Typically, a program will be run once, with no keywords
       specified, to determine what keywords  are  significant  for
       the  current  problem (the keywords are printed in the macro
       output line).  Then the program will be run again, with  the
       desired   keywords,   to  examine  only  specific  areas  of
       interest.


            The second argument to a [1mDBUG_PRINT [22mmacro is a standard
       printf  style  format  string  and  one or more arguments to
       print, all enclosed in parentheses so that they collectively
       become  a  single  macro  argument.   This  is  how variable
       numbers of printf arguments are supported.  Also  note  that
       no  explicit  newline  is  required at the end of the format
       string.  As a matter of style, two or three small [1mDBUG_PRINT[0m
       macros  are  preferable to a single macro with a huge format
       string.  Figure 8 shows the output for default  tracing  and
       debug.

            It is sometimes desirable  to  restrict  debugging  and
       trace  actions  to a specific function or list of functions.
       This is accomplished with the  ‚Äôf‚Äô  flag  character  in  the

       factorial  program  when  run  with   the   control   string

       [1mSUMMARY OF MACROS[0m


            This  section  summarizes  the  usage  of all currently
       defined macros in the [4mdbug[24m package.  The macros  definitions
       are  found in the user include file [1mdbug.h [22mfrom the standard
       include directory.



               DBUG_ENTER  Used to tell the runtime support  module
                           the  name of the function being entered.
                           The argument must be of type "pointer to
                           character".   The  DBUG_ENTER macro must
                           precede  all  executable  lines  in  the
                           function  just  entered,  and  must come
                           after  all  local  declarations.    Each
                           DBUG_ENTER  macro  must  have a matching
                           DBUG_RETURN or DBUG_VOID_RETURN macro at
                           the  function  exit  points.  DBUG_ENTER
                           macros   used   without    a    matching
                           DBUG_RETURN  or  DBUG_VOID_RETURN  macro
                           will cause  warning  messages  from  the
                           [4mdbug[24m package runtime support module.

                           EX: DBUG_ENTER ("main");

              DBUG_RETURN  Used  at  each  exit point of a function
                           containing a  DBUG_ENTER  macro  at  the
                           entry  point.  The argument is the value
                           to return.  Functions  which  return  no
                           value     (void)    should    use    the
                           DBUG_VOID_RETURN macro.  It is an  error
                           to     have     a     DBUG_RETURN     or
                           DBUG_VOID_RETURN  macro  in  a  function
                           which  has no matching DBUG_ENTER macro,
                           and the compiler will  complain  if  the
                           macros are actually used (expanded).

                           EX: DBUG_RETURN (value);
                           EX: DBUG_VOID_RETURN;

             DBUG_PROCESS  Used  to  name the current process being
                           executed.  A typical argument  for  this
                           macro  is  "argv[0]",  though it will be
                           perfectly happy with any  other  string.
                           Im  multi‚Äêthreaded  environment  threads
                           may have different names.

                           EX: DBUG_PROCESS (argv[0]);

                DBUG_PUSH  Sets a new debugger state by pushing the
                           current  [4mdbug[24m  state  onto  an  internal
                           stack and setting up the new state using

                           the  debug  control string passed as the
                           macro argument.  The most  common  usage
                           is to set the state specified by a debug
                           control  string   retrieved   from   the
                           argument  list. If the control string is
                           [4mincremental,[24m the new state is a copy  of
                           the  old  state, modified by the control
                           string.

                           EX: DBUG_PUSH ((argv[i][2]));
                           EX: DBUG_PUSH ("d:t");
                           EX: DBUG_PUSH ("");

                 DBUG_POP  Restores the previous debugger state  by
                           popping  the state stack.  Attempting to
                           pop more  states  than  pushed  will  be
                           ignored  and  no  warning will be given.
                           The DBUG_POP macro has no arguments.

                           EX: DBUG_POP ();

                 DBUG_SET  Modifies the current debugger  state  on
                           top  of  the stack or pushes a new state
                           if the current is  set  to  the  initial
                           settings, using the debug control string
                           passed as the  macro  argument.   Unless
                           [4mincremental[24m  control string is used (see
                           below), it‚Äôs equivalent to a combination
                           of DBUG_POP and DBUG_PUSH.

                           EX: DBUG_SET ("d:t");
                           EX: DBUG_SET ("+d,info");
                           EX: DBUG_SET ("+t:‚Äêd");

                DBUG_FILE  The   DBUG_FILE  macro  is  used  to  do
                           explicit I/O on the debug output stream.
                           It  is  used  in  the same manner as the
                           symbols "stdout"  and  "stderr"  in  the
                           standard I/O package.

                           EX: fprintf (DBUG_FILE, "Doing my own I/O!\n");

             DBUG_EXECUTE  The  DBUG_EXECUTE  macro  is   used   to
                           execute any arbitrary C code.  The first
                           argument is the debug keyword,  used  to

                           as the second argument.  This macro must
                           be  used  cautiously  because,  like the
                           DBUG_PRINT macro,  it  is  automatically
                           selected  by  default  whenever  the ‚Äôd‚Äô
                           flag  has  no  argument  list  (i.e.,  a
                           "‚Äê#d:t" control string).

          DBUG_EXECUTE_IF  Works like DBUG_EXECUTE macro,  but  the
                           code  is  [1mnot  [22mexecuted "by default", if
                           the keyword is not explicitly listed  in
                           the  ‚Äôd‚Äô  flag.  Used  to  conditionally
                           execute  "dangerous"  actions,  e.g   to
                           crash  the  program testing how recovery
                           works, or  to  introduce  an  artificial
                           delay checking for race conditions.

                           EX: DBUG_EXECUTE_IF ("crashme", DBUG_ABORT() ());

            DBUG_EVALUATE  The DBUG_EVALUATE macro  is  similar  to
                           DBUG_EXECUTE,  but it can be used in the
                           expression context. The  first  argument
                           is  the  debug  keyword  that is used to
                           choose whether the  second  (keyword  is
                           enabled)  or  the  third (keyword is not
                           enabled)  argument  is  evaluated.  When
                           [4mdbug[24m is compiled off, the third argument
                           is evaluated.

                           EX:
                             printf("Info‚Äêdebug is %s",
                                    DBUG_EVALUATE ("info",    "ON",
                           "OFF"));

         DBUG_EVALUATE_IF  Works  like DBUG_EVALUATE macro, but the
                           second argument is [1mnot [22mevaluated, if the
                           keyword  is not explicitly listed in the
                           ‚Äôd‚Äô  flag.  Like  DBUG_EXECUTE_IF   this
                           could  be  used to conditionally execute
                           "dangerous" actions.

                           EX:
                               if (prepare_transaction () ||
                                   DBUG_EVALUATE        ("crashme",
                           (DBUG_ABORT(), 0), 0) ||
                                   commit_transaction () )

               DBUG_PRINT  Used  to  do  printing via the "fprintf"
                           library function on  the  current  debug
                           stream,  DBUG_FILE.   The first argument
                           is a debug  keyword,  the  second  is  a
                           format   string  and  the  corresponding
                           argument list.   Note  that  the  format
                           string  and  argument  list  are all one
                           macro argument and [1mmust [22mbe  enclosed  in
                           parentheses.

                           EX: DBUG_PRINT ("eof", ("end of file found"));
                           EX: DBUG_PRINT ("type", ("type is %x",

                DBUG_DUMP  Used to dump a memory block in  hex  via
                           the  "fprintf"  library  function on the
                           current debug  stream,  DBUG_FILE.   The
                           first  argument  is a debug keyword, the
                           second is a pointer to a memory to dump,
                           the third is a number of bytes to dump.

                           EX: DBUG_DBUG ("net", packet, len);

           DBUG_LOCK_FILE  Used  in  multi‚Äêthreaded  environment to
                           lock DBUG_FILE stream.  It can be  used,
                           for  example,  in functions that need to
                           write something to a debug  stream  more
                           than  in  one fprintf() call and want to
                           ensure that no other thread  will  write
                           something in between.

                           EX:
                             DBUG_LOCK_FILE;
                             fprintf (DBUG_FILE, "a=[");
                             for (int i=0; i < a_length; i++)
                               fprintf   (DBUG_FILE,   "0x%03x   ",
                           a[i]);
                             fprintf (DBUG_FILE, "]");
                             DBUG_UNLOCK_FILE;

         DBUG_UNLOCK_FILE  Unlocks  DBUG_FILE  stream,   that   was
                           locked with a DBUG_LOCK_FILE.

              DBUG_ASSERT  This macro just does a regular assert().
                           The  difference  is  that  it  will   be
                           disabled  by  DBUG_OFF  togeher with the
                           [4mdbug[24m library. So there will be  no  need
                           to   disable   asserts  separately  with
                           NDEBUG.

                           EX: DBUG_ASSERT( a > 0 );

               DBUG_ABORT  This macro  could  be  used  instead  of
                           abort().  It flushes DBUG_FILE stream to
                           ensure that no [4mdbug[24m output is  lost  and
                           then calls abort().

             DBUG_EXPLAIN  Generates  control  string corresponding
                           to the current debug state.   The  macro
                           takes  two arguments ‚Äê a buffer to store
                           the result string into and  its  length.
                           The  macro  (which  could  be  used as a
                           function)  returns  1  if  the   control
                           string  didn‚Äôt  fit  into the buffer and
                           was truncated and 0 otherwise.

                           EX:
                             char buf[256];

       [1mDEBUG CONTROL STRING[0m


            The  debug  control  string is used to set the state of
       the debugger via the [1mDBUG_PUSH [22mor [1mDBUG_SET  [22mmacros.  Control
       string  consists  of colon separated flags.  Colons that are
       part of  ‚Äô:\‚Äô,   ‚Äô:/‚Äô,  or  ‚Äô::‚Äô  are  not  considered  flag
       separators.  A  flag  may  take  an  argument  or  a list of
       arguments.  If a control string starts from a  ‚Äô+‚Äô  sign  it
       works  [4mincrementally,[24m  that is, it can modify existing state
       without overriding it.  Every flag may be preceded by a  ‚Äô+‚Äô
       or  ‚Äô‚Äê‚Äô  to  enable or disable a corresponding option in the
       debugger state or to add or remove arguments  to  the  list.
       This  section  summarizes  the  currently available debugger
       options and the flag  characters  which  enable  or  disable
       them.  Argument lists enclosed in ‚Äô[‚Äô and ‚Äô]‚Äô are optional.


                    a[,file] Redirect  the  debugger  output stream
                             and append it to the  specified  file.
                             The  default  output stream is stderr.
                             A null argument list causes output  to
                             be redirected to stdout.

                             EX: a,C:\tmp\log

                    A[,file] Like  ‚Äôa[,file]‚Äô  but ensure that data
                             are written  after  each  write  (this
                             typically     implies     flush     or
                             close/reopen).  It  helps  to  get   a
                             complete  log file in case of crashes.
                             This  mode  is  implicit   in   multi‚Äê
                             threaded environment.

                d[,keywords] Enable   output   from   macros   with
                             specified keywords.  Every keyword can
                             be  a  [4mglob(7)[24m pattern.  An empty list
                             of keywords implies that all  keywords
                             are selected.

                    D[,time] Delay  for  specified  time after each
                             output  line,  to  let  output  drain.
                             Time  is  given  in tenths of a second
                             (value of 10 is one second).   Default
                             is zero.

               f[,functions] Limit    debugger   actions   to   the
                             specified list  of  functions.   Every
                             function can be a [4mglob(7)[24m pattern.  An
                             empty list of functions  implies  that
                             all  functions  are  selected.   Every

       [1mMULTI‚ÄêTHREADED DEBUGGING[0m


            When [4mdbug[24m is used in a multi‚Äêthreaded environment there
       are  few  differences from a single‚Äêthreaded case to keep in
       mind. This section tries to summarize them.


          ¬∑ Every thread has its  own  stack  of  debugger  states.
            [1mDBUG_PUSH  [22mand  [1mDBUG_POP  [22maffect  only  the thread that
            executed them.

          ¬∑ At the bottom of the stack for all threads there is the
            common  [4minitial[24m  state.  Changes  to  this  state  (for
            example, with [1mDBUG_SET_INITIAL [22mmacro)  affect  all  new
            threads  and  all running threads that didn‚Äôt [1mDBUG_PUSH[0m
            yet.

          ¬∑ Every thread can have its own name,  that  can  be  set
            with [1mDBUG_PROCESS [22mmacro. Thus, "‚Äê#p,name1,name2" can be
            used to limit the output to specific threads.

          ¬∑ When printing directly to [1mDBUG_FILE [22mit may be necessary
            to prevent other threads from writing something between
            two parts of logically indivisible output. It  is  done
            with  [1mDBUG_LOCK_FILE  [22mand  [1mDBUG_UNLOCK_FILE [22mmacors. See
            the appropriate section for examples.

          ¬∑ "‚Äê#o,file" and "‚Äê#O,file" are treated as "‚Äê#a,file" and
            "‚Äê#A,file"  respectively.  That is all writes to a file
            are always followed by a flush.

          ¬∑ "‚Äê#i" prints not a PID but a thread id in the  form  of
            "T@nnn"

       [1mHINTS AND MISCELLANEOUS[0m


            One of the most useful capabilities of the [4mdbug[24m package
       is to compare the executions  of  a  given  program  in  two
       different environments.  This is typically done by executing
       the program in the environment where it behaves properly and
       saving the debugger output in a reference file.  The program
       is then run with identical inputs in the  environment  where
       it  misbehaves  and  the  output  is  again  captured  in  a
       reference  file.   The  two  reference  files  can  then  be
       differentially compared to determine exactly where execution
       of the two processes diverges.


            A  related  usage  is  regression  testing  where   the
       execution   of   a   current  version  is  compared  against
       executions of previous versions.  This is most  useful  when
       there are only minor changes.


            It  is  not difficult to modify an existing compiler to
       implement some of the  functionality  of  the  [4mdbug[24m  package
       automatically,  without  source  code changes to the program
       being debugged.  In fact, such changes were implemented in a
       version  of  the  Portable  C Compiler by the author in less
       than a day.  However, it is  strongly  encouraged  that  all
       newly developed code continue to use the debugger macros for
       the  portability  reasons  noted  earlier.    The   modified
       compiler should be used only for testing existing programs.

       [1mCAVEATS[0m


            The  [4mdbug[24m  package  works best with programs which have
       "line oriented" output, such  as  text  processors,  general
       purpose  utilities,  etc.   It can be interfaced with screen
       oriented programs such as visual editors by  redefining  the
       appropriate  macros to call special functions for displaying
       the  debugger  results.   Of  course,  this  caveat  is  not
       applicable  if  the  debugger output is simply dumped into a
       file for post‚Äêexecution examination.


            Programs which use memory  allocation  functions  other
       than  [1mmalloc  [22mwill  usually have problems using the standard
       [4mdbug[24m package.  The most common problem is multiply allocated
       memory.

                                 [4mABSTRACT[0m


       This  document  introduces  [4mdbug[24m,  a macro based C debugging
       package which has proven to be a very  flexible  and  useful
       tool for debugging, testing, and porting C programs.


            All  of the features of the [4mdbug[24m package can be enabled
       or disabled dynamically at execution time.  This means  that
       production  programs will run normally when debugging is not
       enabled, and eliminates the need to  maintain  two  separate
       versions of a program.


            Many   of   the   things   easily   accomplished   with
       conventional debugging tools, such  as  symbolic  debuggers,
       are  difficult  or  impossible  with  this package, and vice
       versa.  Thus the [4mdbug[24m package should [4mnot[24m be thought of as  a
       replacement  or  substitute  for  other debugging tools, but
       simply as a useful [4maddition[24m to the program  development  and
       maintenance environment.
